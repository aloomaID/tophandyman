            <h3>Mililani Town, HI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Mililani sits on former plantation fields owned by Castle & Cooke, which began planning for its development in 1958 under its Oceanic Properties subsidiary. Castle & Cooke's plan was to collaborate with planners and architects on making Mililani Town a satellite city that would satisfy Oʻahu's pent-up demand for housing with a new affordable community. It was planned to eventually support a population of 75,000 people. Architect and developer Al Boeke, who would later create the planned community of Sea Ranch, California, was the development director of Mililani. The first homes in Mililani went on sale on June 23, 1968.</p>
